# Data Analysis Project: Creation of a graph that shows the relationship between temperature and the amount of ice cream solds.  
---
### The project uses a dataset that relates information about ice cream sales and temperature.  
### The objective of the project is to make a graph that facilitates the visualization of this relationship.  
---
#### The following treatment was done on the dataset:    
1. The values in the ['Temperature'] column have been converted from Fahrenheit to Celsius.  
2. The values in the ['Temperature'] column have been placed in descending order, from warmest to mildest temperature.  
4. In the end, a graph was created with the information obtained, which was exported as a pdf.

### **Conclusion:**
1. The analysis was useful to be able to create a graph for better visualization of the dataset relationships.  
2. It can be observed that the amount of ice cream sales on hotter days is greater than on colder days.  
3. Creating a graph using a dataset like this can serve as a model for similar views in other datasets.
